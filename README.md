# BenStream

BenStream is a personal web project I'm building to sharpen my front-end development skills and explore web streaming concepts. The app serves as a simple video streaming platform, allowing for organized display and playback of video content.

## Features

- HTML5 video playback
- Organized file structure with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Currently running locally using VSCode Live Server

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- VSCode with Live Server extension
- Git & GitHub for version control

## Project Goals

- Continue expanding features: search, categories, UI improvements
- Experiment with basic backend functionality (coming soon)
- Build a full-stack version in future iterations

## Why I Built This

This project is part of my ongoing learning in front-end and full-stack web development. I'm using BenStream to apply practical coding skills while building a portfolio project I can continue to grow.

## Status

âœ… MVP live and running locally  
ðŸš§ More features to come. Stay tuned.
